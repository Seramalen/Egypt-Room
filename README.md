# Egypt-Room
This program runs off an Arduino Uno, after the previous Raspberry Pi project failed consistently over a period of two years.
This makes use of an SD Card access library and an audio player library, SD and TMRpcm.
The audio files are messy since the arduino is a bit limited in what it can and cannot do, so the files needed to be a little compressed and the audio quality lowered, but the end result is not noticable.
Two buttons are involved, one that unlocks a magnetic lock and switches the music, and another that plays the sound for a music puzzle.
